Opus is made with Phoenix, an Elixir web framework, and Redis, to Message Queue and PubSub services


Before start the Opus platform, you'll need a Redis server running. You can configurate Redis on elixir script file:

`/config/config.exs`

```
config :exq,
  name: Exq,
  host: "172.17.0.2",
  port: 6379,
```


## Exq? What is?

Exq (Elixir queue) is a job processing library that uses Redis as a store for background processing jobs.

Exq has a UI to manage the jobs:

## To start your Phoenix server:

* Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
* Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`
* **Or just run** `docker-compose up`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
